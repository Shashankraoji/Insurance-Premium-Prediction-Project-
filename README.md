Insurance Premium Prediction Project Report
1. Introduction
Predicting insurance premiums accurately is crucial for insurance companies. It allows for fair pricing, better risk management, and improved customer satisfaction. This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.
2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project was thoroughly explored to understand the distribution and characteristics of the features:
•	Feature Overview: The dataset includes features like age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and the target variable charges which represents the insurance premium.
•	Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables such as sex, smoker status, and region were encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical form for model training.
•	Train-Test Split: The data was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split, ensuring that the model's performance could be evaluated on unseen data.
3. Model Development
Several models were trained and evaluated to predict the insurance premiums:
a. Linear Regression
Linear Regression was the simplest model applied to the data. While easy to implement, it assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable, which may not capture complex patterns in the data.
b. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression was used to capture non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial terms. This model showed a significant improvement in accuracy over Linear Regression, indicating that non-linear interactions between features are important in predicting insurance premiums.
c. Decision Tree Regressor
The Decision Tree Regressor is a non-linear model that works by splitting the data into subsets based on feature values. It captures complex patterns but can be prone to overfitting, particularly when dealing with small datasets.
d. Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It generally performs better than a single decision tree by averaging out the predictions of many trees.
4. Model Evaluation and Comparison
The performance of each model was evaluated using the R-squared (R²) score, which measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model:
•	Linear Regression: Achieved a moderate R² score.
•	Polynomial Regression: Achieved the highest R² score of 85.28%, indicating the best fit to the data among all models tested.
•	Decision Tree Regressor: Provided decent results but with a risk of overfitting.
•	Random Forest Regressor: Performed well, but not as effectively as the Polynomial Regression model.
Model Comparison:
Model	R² Score
Linear Regression	Moderate
Polynomial Regression	85.28%
Decision Tree Regressor	Good
Random Forest Regressor	Very Good
Conclusion: Based on the comparison, Polynomial Regression is recommended as the best model for predicting insurance premiums due to its ability to capture the non-linear relationships in the data and its superior performance (R² score of 85.28%).
5. Impact and Benefits of Accurate Prediction
Accurate insurance premium prediction has several significant benefits:
•	Improved Risk Management: Insurers can better assess the risk associated with individual policyholders, leading to more accurate pricing.
•	Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Fair and accurate premium calculations ensure that customers are charged appropriately, improving trust and satisfaction.
•	Increased Competitiveness: Companies that accurately predict premiums can offer competitive pricing, attracting more customers.
•	Profitability: By accurately assessing risk, insurers can avoid underpricing high-risk clients and overpricing low-risk clients, maintaining profitability.
6. Conclusion
This project demonstrated the process of developing a predictive model for insurance premiums, from data exploration to model evaluation. The Polynomial Regression model emerged as the best-performing model, offering high accuracy and the ability to capture complex relationships in the data. The accurate prediction of insurance premiums is crucial for fair pricing, customer satisfaction, and overall business success.
